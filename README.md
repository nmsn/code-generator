# code-generator

English | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

According to the template of the local code, the code file is generated in the command execution directory, and variables can be injected and variable default values can be set.

## There are problems

- The template is in the form of text, so you cannot use functions such as code highlighting, prompting, error verification, etc.
- Before executing the script on the command line, you must enter the directory where the generated code is located, which is a bit cumbersome.
